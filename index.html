    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      ðŸŽ® Game Developer | Programmer | IT Technician<br>
      <br>
      Iâ€™ve been creating games for several years, primarily using Unreal Engine (since version 5.0.0), which is my preferred engine. Iâ€™m experienced in both C++ and Blueprints. Iâ€™ve also worked with Unity, and once built a game from scratch using OpenGL with C++.<br>
      <br>
      In 2023, three games I co-developed were selected as finalists at the ZTGK game development competition, with two receiving honorable mentions - a milestone that confirmed Iâ€™m on the right track.<br>
      <br>
      Beyond game development:<br>
      ðŸ”¹ I also code in Python and C#, and Iâ€™ve built front-ends using HTML, CSS, and Jinja,<br>
      ðŸ”¹ Iâ€™m familiar with tools like Docker, Jenkins, and YouTrack,<br>
      ðŸ”¹ I have solid experience with both Windows and Linux systems - providing tech support professionally and privately.<br>
      <br>
      I focus on hands-on learning and practical problem-solving - I learn best by building things from the ground up or tackling real-world challenges.
